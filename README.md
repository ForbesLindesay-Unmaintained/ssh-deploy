## API

Each command can also be accessed programatically by calling `deploy[command](remote, options)`, and will return a promise.  e.g.

```js
var deploy = require('ssh-deploy');
deploy.publish('root:password@127.0.0.1', {directory: process.cwd}).then(function () {
  return deploy.start('root:password@127.0.0.1', {directory: process.cwd, host: 'example.com'});
}).done(function () {
  console.log('updated deployment');
});
```

## Auto Complete and Naming Hosts

To configure a .ssh/config file see http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/

To enable tab auto-complete run one of the following commands (depending on your system:

```
ssh-deploy completion >> ~/.bash_profile
ssh-deploy completion >> ~/.bashrc
ssh-deploy completion >> ~/.zshrc
```

This is exactly like adding completion to npm.  Note that it will only auto-complete the command name and the server name (if you have a .ssh/config file).
